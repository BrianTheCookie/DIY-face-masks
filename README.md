# DIY-face-masks (Work In Progress)

A selection of easy reusable face masks to make yourself. We don't want to make a single design or perfect design but we
want to provide a set of design depending of the capabilities of the user.

Homemade face mask are not to substitute to surgical masks, but they may help to prevent the propagation of a virus.

## Selection of raw materials/fabrics

The selection of raw materials can be performed based on the filtration efficiency and hydrophobic capabilities.

![Filtration Efficiency and Pressure Drop Across Materials Tested with Aerosols of Bacillus Atrophaeus and Bacteriophage MS2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adulau/DIY-face-masks/master/images/filtration-efficiency.png)

We read different papers (such as [Testing the Efficacy of Homemade Masks: Would They Protect in an Influenza Pandemic?](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Filtration-Efficiency-and-Pressure-Drop-Across-Materials-Tested-with-Aerosols-of-Bacillus_tbl1_258525804)) and we provide a table of the most efficient fabrics based on their filtering capabilities. The table might be updated based on
new references or scientific papers. If you want to reuse fabrics from old clothes, check the composition and take by priority fabrics listed higher in the table below. A lot of face mask
design allows to have different layers of fabric.

| Priority | Fabric type | Reason   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Non-recycled polyester fabrics    | Hydrophobic     |
| 2 | Recycled polyester fabrics | Hydrophobic (fiber less compact than virgin polyester) |
| 3 | Mixed/blend cotton - Poly Cotton | Partially hydrophobic |
| 4 | 100% cotton | Cheap and accessible but less efficient than the above listed |
| 10 | Silk | Not recommended (too thin at fiber level) but still better than nothing |

## How to use and clean your masks

- Do not touch the mask and its fasteners while you are wearing it.
- A mask must be specific to each person. Do not lend or exchange it.
- Wash at 30 ° C after each use.
- Dry the mask thoroughly including straps.

There are also alternative cleaning solution such as hydrogen peroxide but these solutions might not be accessible to everyone.

## TODO

- Test design patterns without sewing machine
- Import table with raw materials
- Printable version of patterns and instructions for diffusion to public in rural areas (feedback needed on specific awareness in such area)
- Make a list of tools needed for sewing masks

## Designs

### Design 1 - mask with sewing at nose/center level - sewing pattern made from the hand

The face mask uses rubber bands for hair.

### Design 2 - mask with sewing at nose/center level - standard patterns

Two layers of cotton, breathability is ok. Pass a thin metal wire (used in gardening) all along the high edge, good support near the nose.

### Design 3 - mask folded fabrics without sewing at nose/center level

Based on [DIY Covid-19 Fabric Mask (with Filter Pocket) Sewing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RWII2-5_4), simpler than the previous ones to make but also requires an iron to make the folds and pliers to hold folds during sewing. Cover the face well but go up too much on the nose and let air pass up at the level of the wings of the nose.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome if any amelioration is made on the patterns, techniques and the project in general

It is also possible to directly ask on twitter via DM:

- All questions related to the project to [project coordinator @ko97551819](https://twitter.com/ko97551819), answers will be in the FAQ next.
- All design and specific sewing questions to [sewing expert lead](https://twitter.com/c0n1c)
- All fabrics and filtering efficiency questions [filtering expert lead](https://twitter.com/adulau)

By the way, don't take the titles above seriously.

Feel free to add any patterns or design too, by pulling a request.
Translation is also welcome, in target languages of the country you live in.
Support low-cost open hardware, share and clone the repository.

We also keep track of [failed design patterns](FAILED.md). If you want to share your failed designs, we are also interested.

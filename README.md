# DIY-face-masks (Work In Progress)

A selection of easy reusable face masks to make yourself. We don't want to make a single design or perfect design but we
want to provide a set of design depending of the capabilities of the user.

Homemade face mask are not to substitute to surgical masks, but they may help to prevent the propagation of a virus.

## Selection of raw materials

The selection of raw materials can be performed based on the filtration efficiency and hydrophobic capabilities.

![Filtration Efficiency and Pressure Drop Across Materials Tested with Aerosols of Bacillus Atrophaeus and Bacteriophage MS2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adulau/DIY-face-masks/master/images/filtration-efficiency.png)

We read different papers (such as [Testing the Efficacy of Homemade Masks: Would They Protect in an Influenza Pandemic?](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Filtration-Efficiency-and-Pressure-Drop-Across-Materials-Tested-with-Aerosols-of-Bacillus_tbl1_258525804)) and we provide a table of the most efficient fabrics based on their filtering capabilities. The table might be updated based on
new references or scientific papers.

| Priority | Fabric type | Reason   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Non-recycled polyester fabrics    | Hydrophobic     |
| 2 | Recycled polyester fabrics | Hydrophobic (fiber less compact than virgin polyester) |
| 3 | Mixed/blend cotton - Poly Cotton | Partially hydrophobic |
| 4 | 100% cotton | Cheap and accessible but less efficient than the above listed |
| 10 | Silk | Not recommended (too thin at fiber level) but still better than nothing |


## TODO

- Test design patterns without sewing machine
- Import table with raw materials
- Printable version of patterns and instructions for diffusion to public in rural areas (feedback needed on specific awareness in such area)
- Make a list of tools needed for sewing masks

## Designs

### Design 1 - mask with sewing at nose/center level - sewing pattern made from the hand

![Face mask result from the pattern made from the hand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C00kie-/DIY-face-masks/master/images/prototypes/prototype_coco1.jpeg)

The face mask uses rubber bands for hair.

### Design 2 - mask with sewing at nose/center level - standard patterns

### Design 3 - mask folded fabrics without sewing at nose/center level
